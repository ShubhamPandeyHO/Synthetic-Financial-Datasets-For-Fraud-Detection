The difference in accuracy between deep learning and traditional machine learning models may be attributed to the complexity and non-linear nature of the data

In deep learning, models like neural networks can automatically learn intricate patterns and representations from the data. Deep learning models, especially deep neural networks, are capable of capturing complex relationships, hierarchies, and non-linearities in the data. This makes them well-suited for tasks where the underlying patterns are intricate and difficult to represent with traditional machine learning models.

On the other hand, traditional machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, may struggle to capture highly complex relationships in the data. They rely on predefined features and assumptions about the data distribution. If the data contains intricate patterns that these models cannot effectively capture, their accuracy may be limited.

The observed higher accuracy in deep learning models (94%) suggests that the data may have non-linear patterns that deep neural networks can exploit. In contrast, traditional machine learning models might not have the capacity to capture these patterns, leading to lower accuracy.

In summary, the choice between deep learning and traditional machine learning depends on the complexity of the data and the patterns you aim to capture. Deep learning models excel in tasks with intricate patterns, while traditional machine learning models may be sufficient for simpler relationships. It's essential to consider the nature of your data and the specific requirements of your task when selecting a modeling approach.
